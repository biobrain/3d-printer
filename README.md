Thanks to  [A. M. Winkler](https://brainder.org/author/andersonwinkler/) the [srf2obj](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2785709/brainder/2012/srf2obj/srf2obj) is on the brainder's [web page](https://brainder.org/2012/05/08/importing-freesurfer-cortical-meshes-into-blender/).

I uploaded the current version of the program to keep my script running well.

srf2obj4blender is used for generating obj files for the brain hemisphere and subcortical structures
segmented for blender.
